# Lara-docker

This repository shows how you can organize a Laravel project with Docker and all the extra tools you might need for a real-world application.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside

- **Nginx Configuration**
  * Example Nginx settings for serving your Laravel application. Place your custom configs in the nginx/ directory and mount them into your container as needed.
- **PostgreSQL & MSSQL Drivers**
  * The Docker image is prepared to install both PostgreSQL and MSSQL drivers. This allows your Laravel app to connect to external PostgreSQL or MSSQL databases by simply configuring your .env
- **Supervisor Setup**
  * Includes a sample supervisord.conf for running background processes such as php artisan queue:work or php artisan horizon. You can adjust the configuration to manage any additional Laravel workers you require
- **cron Configuration**
  * Provides a custom crontab file and Docker instructions for running Laravel's scheduled tasks (php artisan schedule:run) every minute. This ensures your scheduled jobs are executed automatically inside the container
- **Horizon**
  * Horizon Configuration
  Example Supervisor and environment settings for running Laravel Horizon, giving you a dashboard and process manager for your queues.

## üß© Example: Adding Supervisor and cron

- **Supervisor** runs background processes like
  `php artisan queue:work` or `php artisan horizon` automatically.
- **cron** runs Laravel's scheduled tasks every minute using
  `php artisan schedule:run`.

## üí° Quick Notes

- Use this as a starting point for your own Laravel Docker setup.
- You‚Äôll need to add your own Laravel code and adjust the configs.
- This is for local development and learning, **not for production use**.
